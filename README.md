**miaou-builder** builds [miaou](https://github.com/Canop/miaou).

If you're not interested in Miaou, you're not interested in miaou-builder:
there's no configuration because miaou-builder can't be used for anything else.

This replaces the gulp based builder which was previously used.

## Usage

```bash
MIAOU_ROOT=some/path miaou-builder all
```
