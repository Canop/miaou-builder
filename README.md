**miaou-builder** builds [miaou](https://github.com/Canop/miaou).

When ready, it will replace the old gulpfile currently used.

If you're not interested in Miaou, you're not interested in miaou-builder:
there's no configuration because miaou-builder can't be used for anything else.

## Progress

* [x] build miaou (so, it works)
* [ ] lint server JS
* [ ] lint client JS
* [ ] lint SCSS
* [ ] integrate to bacon

## Usage

MIAOU_ROOT=some/path miaou-builder all
```
